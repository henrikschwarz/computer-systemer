Types of memory:
	RAM - Random access memory
	Main memory
	ROM - Read only memory
	EEROM - Electrically erasable read only memory
	EEPROM - Electrically erasable read only memory
	Flash - Flash memory

Adress decoding:
	We can check if we are in the right memory area by checking the 2 most
	significant bits
	3 scenarios (check slides from lecture 5 page 10)
		11 = use AND gate
		01 = use NOT connected to AND gate
		00 = use 2 NOT connected to AND gate

Communicating with other devices:
	Cotnroller
		Hanldes communication between devices
		Specialized devices
		USB
	Port
		Point device connects to
	Memory mapped I/O
		Memory mapped I/O
	Direct memory access
		Von neumann bottle neck
	Handshaking
		Handshaking er overholdse af en protocol
		Aftal en protokol
			IE. API, HTTP, Distributed systems, multiprocessor
			systemer
		Protocol needs to agree on:
			Sequence, Language, Format, Speed, etc..
	Popular communication techniques:
		Parallel communication:
			Several lines transfer at the same time
		Serial communication:
			Signals transfered over one line (USB)
	I/O standards
		RS-232, USB, HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, Analog radio
Expand control bus (slide 18):
	1 bit for READ and WRITE
	1 bit for timing data transfer
	1 bit for determining if it is ain memory or I/O controller
	Other solution (slide 19):
		Include the I/O addresse in the main memory address space

Other archtiectures:
	Pipelining
	Parallel processing
	SISD
	MIMD
	SIMD
