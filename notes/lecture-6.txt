Software classification:
	See the chart from slide 10-13 in lecture slide 6

real-time computers
	Computere der skal holde øje med tid og tjekke ting præcist

Embededsystems:
	uses operating systems like:
		freeRTOS
		threadX
		microC
		VxWorks

Process state:
	New - just made 
	Ready - Has resources, waiting for cpu time
	Running - Running on the cpu 
	Waiting - Waiting for I/O
	Terminated - process finished
	See diagram on slide 23
Process handling
	Scheduler
		Adds new processes to the process table and removes completed ones
	Dispatcher
		Controls the allocation of time slices to the processes in the process
		table
	Context switching
		saves and restores states when switching between processes

Concurrent process handling
	Critical region
		Instructions that should only be executed by one process of a
		time.
		Tools for handling critial region:
			Semaphore - Control flag
			Mutual exclusion - Requirement for only one process
			running in the region
	Race condition
		When more processes use the same critial resource
		Can result in inconsistent data
	Deadlock
		Processes that block eachother because they are waiting for a
		resource the other one has
		See slide 36
