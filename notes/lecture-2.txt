Types of flip-flops:
	- SR flip-flop
		- S is for set
		- R is for reset
	- D flip-flop
		- D flip flop uses a clk input. When the clk goes from low to
		  high the flip-flop outputs and saves the state of input D
	- More examples in the links

Bytes
	- Size is 8 bits
	- 2^8 possible values
	- Right most bit is MSB ( most significant bit)
	- Left most bit is LSB ( least significant bit)
	
Memory:
	- Contains cells of 8 bits
	- Is addressed according to 8 bits (or 1 byte)
		- IE. first 8 bytes have address 0001, next 8 bits has address
		  0002, and so on
	- If a system is 64 bit it is still addressed like a 8 bit system
		- IE. First 64 bits are addressed as 0001, next 64 bits are
		  addressed as 0008
			- That is because 64 bit is 8*8 bit

Binary representation
	- Fractions
		- Fixed point (4.4) system
			- first 4 bits are positive powers of 2 (2^0, 2^1, 2^2,
			  2^3) and the last 4 are negative powers of 2 ( 2^-1,
			  2^-2, 2^-3, 2^-4)
	- Negative
		- 2's complement
			- MSB is bit that indicates negative value
			- Uses addition
			- Careful about overflow
	- Excess notation
		- Find the middle and then the upper part is positive and the
		  bottom negative.
			- IE. Excess 4bit is 1000 = 0 and 1001 = -1
	- Floating point
		- Used for representing floats
